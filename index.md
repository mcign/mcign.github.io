## MCIGN - The Keyless Motorcycle Ignition

### What is MCIGN?

The MCIGN project seamlessly adds a "keyless start" to stock motorcycle ignitions and makes it nearly impossible to hotwire or force the ignition. All modifications are contained in the stock ignition housing, allowing for a stock appearance. The modified ignition communicates with a control app on a smartphone over a BLE connection with an extra layer of encryption to make up for weaknesses in BLE (like limited OOB pairing options on Android). An optional proximity mode can automatically turn the bike on, either in a trusted location such as a garage or wherever the bike was last parked. The original function of the lock mechanism is not altered, and the key works as expected. An optional "digital killswitch" module makes hotwiring nearly impossible by preventing the bike from starting unless it recieves an encrypted command from the modified ignition (most stock motorcycles detect an unlocked ignition by checking the resistance between two wires, and can be hotwired very easily).
